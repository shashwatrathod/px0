# Git Awareness, Diffing & Stage/Commit/Push/Pull

This document describes the design and implementation of px0's git integration engine ([`git.go`](../../git.go)), its diff-rendering frontend ([`web/src/diff.js`](../../web/src/diff.js)), and the sidebar git panel that stages, commits, pushes, and pulls ([`web/src/gitpanel.js`](../../web/src/gitpanel.js), [`web/src/tree.js`](../../web/src/tree.js)).

## 1. Zero-Dependency Shell-Out Architecture

px0 avoids heavy third-party Go git libraries (such as `go-git`, which can consume large amounts of memory re-parsing packfiles, or `libgit2`, which requires CGO).

Instead, px0 adheres to a Pure Shell-Out Architecture:

- Shells out directly to the host `git` binary, for reads (`status`, `diff`, `merge-base`) and, since the git panel, for writes (`add`, `reset`, `commit`, `push`, `fetch`, `merge --ff-only`, `reset --hard`).
- Status and diffing themselves never stage, commit, or change refs or the index — that half of the engine is still purely read-only. The git panel's write endpoints (`/api/git/stage`, `unstage`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`) are the only exception, and every one of them fires exactly once per explicit click; nothing runs on a timer or in response to a file change. See §9.
- A dispatched coding harness ([Harness Editing & Agent Dispatch](agent-editing.md)) can still write anything else in the workspace — including, via **Commit with AI**, the *text* of a commit message — but never touches git state itself; only px0's own git-panel endpoints do that.
- Zero disk footprint: holds all status and diff structures in volatile memory on the `Index` (`Node.Status`, `Node.Staged`).
- Graceful degradation: if `git` is not installed, or if the opened directory is not a git repository, git features degrade silently without warnings or errors.
- Can be disabled explicitly using the `-no-git` CLI flag.

## 2. Concurrent Status Generation

On large repositories, running `git status` can take 50-100 milliseconds. Running this serially during startup would delay index readiness.

px0 runs `git status` concurrently alongside the filesystem walk:

```go
gsCh := make(chan map[string]string, 1)
go func() { gsCh <- gitStatus(ix.root) }()

// Walk directory tree concurrently...
walk(ix.root, "", root)

// Overlay git status onto index nodes
gs := <-gsCh
```

### Git Command Specification

px0 invokes:

```bash
git status --porcelain=v2 -z
```

- `--porcelain=v2`: Machine-readable format immune to user git config customizations.
- `-z`: NUL-delimited output preventing issues with filenames containing spaces, tabs, quotes, or Unicode characters.

## 3. In-Memory Status & Dirty Folder Propagation

Git status codes are mapped onto tree nodes:

- `M`: Modified
- `A`: Added / Staged
- `D`: Deleted
- `U`: Untracked
- `R`: Renamed

Separately, `Node.Staged` (a plain bool, not folded into the status letter) tracks whether a file has staged index changes — see §9 for how the git panel populates and reacts to it.

### Ancestor Folder Dirty Propagation (`Node.Dirty`)

When a file is modified, its status is recorded on its `Node.Status`. Furthermore, every ancestor folder in its path hierarchy is marked `Dirty: true`:

```go
for p := rel; p != ""; {
    if i := strings.LastIndexByte(p, '/'); i >= 0 {
        p = p[:i]
    } else {
        p = ""
    }
    for i := range children[p] {
        if children[p][i].Dir && isAncestor(children[p][i].Path, rel) {
            children[p][i].Dirty = true
        }
    }
}
```

This enables the file tree in the sidebar to visually highlight collapsed directories that contain modified descendants, allowing developers to immediately spot repository changes.

## 4. Diffing: One Git Call, Two Consumers, Three Views

Both the line gutter and the full diff view are read off the same shell-out, `gitDiff(root, relpath)`:

```bash
git diff --no-color HEAD -- <path>
```

The raw unified diff text is cached at that call site; everything downstream (line-range extraction in Go, and hunk parsing in the browser) is a pure parse of that one string, so a file is never diffed against `HEAD` more than once per request.

### Gutter Change Indicators (`/api/gutter?path=...`)

When viewing a file, the editor displays green, blue, and red markers in the line gutter indicating local edits. `gitHunks(root, relpath)` (`git.go`) runs `gitDiff` and walks its `@@ -l,s +l,s @@` hunk headers and `+`/`-` lines with a small state machine, bucketing every changed line into 1-based **new-file** line numbers:

- `added`: Pure insertions.
- `modified`: Lines replaced (a `-` run immediately followed by a `+` run).
- `deleted`: One marker per pure-deletion run, placed at the new-file line the deletion sat before.

`/api/gutter` returns these three arrays; `web/src/tabs.js` fetches them once per opened tab and `web/src/renderer.js` paints them as `box-shadow` bars (added/modified) or a small wedge (deleted) on the `.g` line-number cell — O(1) per visible row, no re-parsing on scroll.

### File Diff (`/api/diff?path=...`)

`handleDiff` (`server.go`) returns `{ path, diff, available }` — the same raw text `gitDiff` produced, with `available` set whenever it's non-empty (clean or untracked files get `""`). No hunk parsing happens on the server for this endpoint; the client owns that, because it needs two different reshapes of the same hunks (split and unified) and re-parsing client-side avoids two server round trips or two response shapes for one diff.

### Split & Unified Views (`web/src/diff.js`)

The active tab gets a `Source | Diff` switch next to the tab bar (`#diff-switch`, shown only when `d.diffAvailable`) whenever the open file is modified in a git repo. `#diff-source` and `#diff-btn` each show their own view, and hovering the Diff half opens the Split/Unified menu; `Cmd/Ctrl+D` toggles the same thing, resuming whichever layout was used last (`localStorage['px0.diffLayout']`, default `split`). Diff view and the Markdown preview are mutually exclusive — entering one hides the other — and each tab remembers its own state on `d.diffMode` (`'split' | 'unified' | null`).

Unlike the main code view, the diff is **not** rendered through the virtualized `#rows` viewport. A single file's diff is small (bounded by the size of that one file), so `diff.js` renders it as plain DOM into a dedicated `#diffview` overlay — the same overlay-over-`#viewport` pattern the Markdown preview uses (see [Markdown Preview](markdown.md)), just with its own content:

1. **Parse.** `parseDiff(text)` splits the raw diff on `@@ ... @@` hunk headers and walks each hunk's `+`/`-`/context lines once, tagging every row `add` / `del` / `ctx` and carrying its old-file and/or new-file line number. This runs once per file per session; the parsed hunks are cached on `d.diffHunks` so switching Split ↔ Unified re-renders from memory with no re-fetch.
1. **Unified layout.** One row per parsed line: old-line column, new-line column (whichever side doesn't apply is blank), a `+`/`-` marker, and the code — a direct read of `d.diffHunks`, GitHub-"unified"-style.
1. **Split layout.** `pairRows(hunk.rows)` walks each hunk and pairs a deletion run with the addition run immediately following it, index by index, padding the shorter side with a blank cell (`.diff-blank`) — the same replacement-block pairing GitHub's split view uses. Context lines pass straight across both columns unpaired. Each pair renders as one flex row with a left/right half, so the two columns stay vertically aligned for free — no synced-scroll JavaScript, because both halves of a pair are literally the same DOM row.

Every rendered row that exists in the working tree carries its line in `data-l`, on both halves of a split context row; a deleted row carries `data-at`, the working-tree line it sat before. `selbar.js` reads these so a selection anywhere in the diff can drive the selection bar, the right-click menu and Edit with Agent (see [Harness Editing & Agent Dispatch](agent-editing.md)).

Both layouts share the same hunk-header, line-number, marker, and code-cell builders; only the row-shape (one column vs. two) differs, so a fix to how a line renders never needs to be made twice.

## 5. Real-Time Streaming & Adaptive Monitoring Engine

To keep git statuses, sidebar badges, and editor gutter diff indicators in sync without requiring manual page reloads or full workspace re-indexing, px0 uses a hybrid real-time monitoring engine (`git_watcher.go` and `web/src/gitstream.js`).

### Design Constraints: Small vs. Massive Repositories

| Approach | Small Repo (< 1k files) | Massive Repo (> 100k files, e.g. Linux / Chromium) | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recursive FS Watcher (`inotify`)** | Fast, low RAM | Exhausts OS watch descriptors (`max_user_watches`), high memory footprint, breaks across symlinks / mount points | **Rejected** |
| **Fixed High-Frequency Polling** | Instant updates (~6ms) | Heavy CPU and battery drain (100k+ file `git status` takes 150ms-1s) | **Rejected** |
| **px0 Hybrid Adaptive Engine** | Sub-millisecond latency, zero RAM overhead | Sub-millisecond on CLI git actions; worktree polling throttled dynamically; CPU usage bounded $\le 10\%$ | **Adopted** |

### Dual-Layer Hybrid Architecture

1. **Sub-millisecond Metadata Stat-Checking (Fast Path)**
   - Every 1 second, px0 checks the `os.Stat` timestamps and sizes of key `.git` control files: `.git/index`, `.git/HEAD`, and `.git/packed-refs`.
   - Any git operation performed in the terminal (`git commit`, `git checkout`, `git add`, `git reset`, `git merge`) immediately touches these files.
   - When a metadata change is detected, px0 triggers an immediate `UpdateGitStatus()` and broadcasts the delta to the frontend within milliseconds without waiting for the next worktree poll.

2. **Adaptive Worktree Polling (Worktree Path)**
   - To catch file changes made outside the git CLI (e.g. saving an editor file or external scripts), the engine polls `UpdateGitStatus()`.
   - **Self-Tuning Frequency**: Measures the exact execution time of the previous `git status` call and adjusts the polling interval:
     $$\text{interval} = \max(2\,\text{s}, \min(15\,\text{s}, \text{execution\_time} \times 10))$$
     On small repositories (~6ms execution), it polls every 2 seconds. On massive repositories (~1s execution), it expands the interval to 10-15 seconds, ensuring git polling never consumes more than a modest fraction of one CPU core.

3. **Visibility & Focus Gating**
   - **Page Visibility API**: When the browser tab is hidden (`document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`), the frontend closes the SSE connection. The backend detects zero active subscribers and pauses background worktree polling completely, saving CPU and laptop battery.
   - **Instant Focus Wakeup**: When the user switches back to px0 (`focus` or `visibilitychange` to visible), the client reconnects and immediately issues a POST to `/api/git/refresh` to catch any changes made while the user was in another application.

4. **In-Memory Concurrency & Tree Updates (`UpdateGitStatus`)**
   - Refreshing git status does not re-walk the directory tree on disk.
   - `Index.UpdateGitStatus()` executes `gitStatus(ix.root)` concurrently, compares the new status map against `ix.gitStatusMap`, and if changed, updates `Node.Status` and `Node.Dirty` in-place on existing `ix.children` nodes.
   - If the status map is identical, no memory allocations or broadcasts occur.

5. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Stream (`/api/stream` / `/api/git/stream`)**
   - Implemented using Go standard library `http.Flusher` without external dependencies.
   - Dispatches structured events (`git-status` and `metrics`):
     ```
     event: git-status
     data: {"git":true,"gitChanges":2,"gitFiles":["main.go","git.go"],"statuses":{"main.go":"M","git.go":"M"},"dirtyDirs":{"web":true}}
     ```
   - Sends `: ping\n\n` comments every 15 seconds to keep connections alive across reverse proxies.

6. **In-Place DOM Patching (`web/src/tree.js`)**
   - The frontend receives the delta payload and calls `patchTreeGitStatus(statuses, dirtyDirs)`.
   - Rather than tearing down the sidebar file tree, it toggles `.dirty` on directory rows and updates badge elements (`.gs`) and `.git-*` status classes on affected file rows.
   - Tab diff dots (`.tab-git-dot`), diff toggle buttons (`#diff-switch`), and active editor gutter lines are refreshed in-place without disturbing scroll position or editor state.

## 6. How Git Detects Changes Under the Hood

To understand why px0's metadata stat-checking fast path works in sub-milliseconds, it is essential to understand how Git itself detects changes in the working tree.

### The Stat Cache (`.git/index`)

Git does **not** read or compute cryptographic hashes (SHA-1 / SHA-256) of every file in the repository on every status check. On a 50,000-file repository, reading and hashing gigabytes of source code would take tens of seconds and stall developer workflows.

Instead, Git maintains a binary cache in `.git/index` containing metadata for every tracked file:

* **`mtime`**: Last modified timestamp (stored as seconds and nanoseconds).
* **`ctime`**: Status change timestamp.
* **`size`**: Exact file size in bytes (truncated to 32 bits).
* **`inode` & `dev`**: File system device and inode numbers.
* **`mode`**: File permissions (e.g. `100644` standard, `100755` executable, `120000` symlink).
* **`blob SHA`**: The hash of the file contents when it was last staged or committed.

```
Working Tree File                      .git/index (Binary Cache)
┌─────────────────────────┐            ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ src/main.go             │            │ src/main.go                            │
│ - size: 4,120 bytes     │  lstat()   │ - cached size: 4,120 bytes             │
│ - mtime: 09:15:02.1492  │ ◄────────► │ - cached mtime: 09:15:02.1492          │
│ - inode: 849201         │  metadata  │ - cached inode: 849201                 │
│                         │ comparison │ - blob SHA: 3a7f92b1c8e0...            │
└─────────────────────────┘            └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The `lstat()` Fast-Path

When `git status` or `git diff` runs:

1. **Lightweight System Call**: Git calls `lstat()` on each working tree file. `lstat()` only reads filesystem directory entries and inode records; it does not read file contents.
2. **Metadata Comparison**: Git compares the file's live `mtime`, `size`, `inode`, and `mode` against the record stored in `.git/index`.
3. **Instant Skip (Unchanged)**: If the metadata matches identically, Git **guarantees the file is untouched**. It skips reading or hashing the file completely.
4. **Targeted Read (Modified)**: Only when the timestamp, size, or mode differs does Git open the file, calculate its blob SHA, and compare it against the cached `blob SHA`.
5. **Merkle Tree Pruning (`Index` vs `HEAD`)**: For comparing staged files against the `HEAD` commit, Git compares the 20-byte/32-byte tree hashes. If a directory tree hash matches `HEAD`, the entire subdirectory subtree is skipped in memory without examining individual files.

Because `lstat()` is memory-cached by the OS VFS page cache, a full `git status` scan across 50,000 files completes in 10–25 milliseconds.

### Why Every Git CLI Command Touches `.git/index`

Whenever a developer runs a Git command in the terminal (`git checkout`, `git reset`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git restore`, `git stash`, or `git merge`):

* Git updates the working tree and writes a new index via an atomic `.git/index.lock` swap (`rename()`).
* This atomic rename guarantees that the `mtime` and `ctime` of `.git/index` change.
* Git also updates `.git/HEAD` or ref pointers (`.git/refs/heads/<branch>` or `.git/packed-refs`).

By monitoring the `os.Stat` timestamp of just `.git/index`, `.git/HEAD`, and `.git/packed-refs`, px0's fast path detects any terminal Git action in sub-millisecond time without scanning the workspace.

## 7. End-to-End Reactive Streaming Architecture

The following sequence illustrates the entire lifecycle from an external git checkout/reset command in a terminal to the real-time UI reconciliation in the browser:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Dev as Developer (Terminal / CLI)
    participant FS as Local Filesystem (.git/index)
    participant GW as px0 GitWatcher (Go Backend)
    participant SSE as SSE Stream (/api/git/stream)
    participant JS as Browser Frontend (gitstream.js)
    participant UI as DOM (Tree, Tabs, Diff Overlay)

    Dev->>FS: Run `git checkout -- file.go` or `git reset`
    FS-->>FS: Atomic rename of `.git/index.lock` -> `.git/index`
    Note over GW: metaTicker (1s) checks os.Stat on .git/index
    GW->>FS: os.Stat(".git/index")
    FS-->>GW: mtime changed!
    GW->>GW: UpdateGitStatus() runs concurrent `git status --porcelain=v2`
    GW->>SSE: Broadcast JSON payload {statuses, gitChanges, dirtyDirs}
    SSE-->>JS: EventSource receives `git-status` event
    JS->>UI: patchTreeGitStatus(statuses, dirtyDirs) (removes .dirty badges)
    JS->>UI: Reconcile open tabs (auto-close discarded diff tabs)
    JS->>UI: If clean and in changed-only mode -> switch to files explorer
```

### Auto-Closing Discarded / Reset Diff Tabs

When developers use px0 to inspect AI agent changes or review git branches, they frequently open modified files directly in git diff view (`diffMode: 'split' | 'unified'`). When changes to those files are subsequently discarded or checked out in the terminal (`git checkout -- file` or `git reset`):

1. **Diff Tab Tracking**: Tabs opened with git changes or toggled into diff view are tagged with `openedInDiffView = true` alongside `diffMode` in [`web/src/tabs.js`](../../web/src/tabs.js).
2. **Reverse-Order Reconciliation**: When `handleGitStatus(data)` receives an updated status payload where `statuses[t.path]` is clean (`!isDiff`):
   ```javascript
   for (let i = S.tabs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
     const t = S.tabs[i];
     if (t.diffRef) continue; // pinned to a commit; see §10
     const code = statuses[t.path];
     const isDiff = !!code && code !== 'U';
     const wasDiff = !!(t.diffMode || t.openedInDiffView);
     if (wasDiff && (t.diffAvailable || t.diffMode) && !isDiff) {
       closeTab(i);
     }
   }
   ```
   Iterating in reverse index order ensures index stability when removing multiple tabs simultaneously.
3. **Active Pointer Stability**: In `closeTab(i)`, closing tabs to the left of the currently active tab decrements `S.active` (`S.active--`) rather than jumping the user to an unintended tab.
4. **Empty State & Explorer Fallback**: If all git changes are discarded while the sidebar is in changed-only mode (`#tree.changed-only`), px0 automatically toggles back to standard file explorer mode so the user is never left viewing an empty tree.

## 8. Diffing Against an Arbitrary Base

`gitDiff`/`gitHunks` above are thin `base="HEAD"` wrappers around `gitDiffAgainst`/`gitHunksAgainst`, which take an arbitrary base ref rather than assuming the working tree's `HEAD`. The one other caller is PR review (`px0 <url>`), which diffs a checked-out PR against its merge-base with the target branch instead. See [GitHub PR Review](github-pr-review.md).

## 9. Stage, Commit, Push, Pull

The sidebar git panel (`web/src/gitpanel.js`) and the file tree's per-row stage tick (`web/src/tree.js`) are the write half of git integration. Every action is a single explicit HTTP call from a button or tick click; nothing here is triggered by the status watcher, a timer, or a file change.

### Staged-Path Tracking

`gitStagedPaths(root)` (`git.go`) runs `git diff --name-only --cached -z` and maps each path through the same `repoRelKey` helper `gitStatusAgainst` uses, so staged state is keyed identically to status. `Index.gitStagedMap` and `Node.Staged` carry it alongside the existing `gitStatusMap`/`Node.Status`, populated in both `Index.Build()` and `Index.UpdateGitStatus()`. `UpdateGitStatus`'s "did anything change" check compares *both* maps — staging a file often leaves its collapsed status letter unchanged (a modified-and-unstaged `M` and a modified-and-staged `M` are the same letter), so comparing status alone would silently swallow a stage/unstage broadcast. `GitStatusPayload` (`git_watcher.go`) carries the resulting `Staged` map and the current `Branch` name (`gitCurrentBranch`) down the same SSE stream (`/api/stream`) that already pushes status.

### Stage / Unstage / Commit

`gitStage`/`gitUnstage`/`gitCommit` (`git.go`) are thin wrappers around `git add -- <path>`, `git reset -- <path>`, and `git commit -m <message>`. An empty path to `gitStage` means "the served root itself", so **Stage All** reuses the same `/api/git/stage` endpoint with `path: "."` instead of a dedicated route. `gitCommit` checks `gitStagedPaths` before shelling out, so an empty index fails fast with "nothing staged to commit" rather than surfacing git's own message. All three endpoints (`handleGitStage`, `handleGitUnstage`, `handleGitCommit` in `server.go`) validate `path` through `s.safePath` — the same traversal guard `handleFile`/`handleRaw` use — and call `s.gitWatcher.Trigger()` on success so the SSE stream broadcasts immediately instead of waiting for the next poll tick.

### Fast-Forward-Only Pull

`gitFFOnlyPull(root, remote, ref)` fetches `ref` from `remote` and runs `git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD`. If that merge fails for any reason, it returns the sentinel `errNotFastForward` without having touched history — px0 never falls back to a real merge, so there is never a conflicted state to clean up. `handleGitPull` (`server.go`) checks `gitHasUncommittedChanges` first and refuses outright (409) if the working tree is dirty, then resolves the branch's upstream (`gitUpstream`, wrapping `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref <branch>@{u}`) and calls `gitFFOnlyPull`. A `409` with `errNotFastForward` becomes a plain-language refusal ("can't fast-forward ... resolve manually, not supported here") rather than raw git output.

In a PR review session, Pull instead re-syncs with the pull request's current head — see [GitHub PR Review §7](github-pr-review.md).

### Push

For a plain workspace, `handleGitPush` runs a bare `gitPush` (`git push`); if that fails specifically because the branch has no upstream, it retries once with `gitPushSetUpstream(root, "origin", branch)`. Neither path ever forces. In a PR review session, `s.pr.Push()` takes over instead — see [GitHub PR Review §7](github-pr-review.md).

### Commit with AI

**Commit with AI** is a text-generation dispatch, not a file edit: `agentManager.StartPrompt(label, prompt)` (`agent.go`) is a sibling of `StartBatch` that skips every file-range concern — no snippet read, no overlap check, no target path — and reuses the same `run()` executor (spawn, stream stdout/stderr into `tailBuffer`s, `changedSince` diff). `handleGitCommitMessage` (`server.go`) builds the prompt from the staged file paths (`gitStagedFiles`), diffstat (`gitStagedStat`), capped staged diff (`gitStagedDiff`), and the `git.commitMessageInstruction` setting via `commitMessagePrompt` (`agent.go`), and refuses with 400 before ever dispatching a harness if nothing is staged. The frontend polls the returned job through the same `/api/agent/job` endpoint an inline edit uses, drops the (fence-stripped) `stdout` into the commit textarea, and immediately calls `/api/git/commit` with it — two endpoints, one user action.

### HTTP Surface

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/git/stage` | POST | `{path}` — stage a file, or `"."` for everything. |
| `/api/git/unstage` | POST | `{path}` — unstage a file. |
| `/api/git/commit` | POST | `{message}` — commit whatever is staged. `400` if nothing is. |
| `/api/git/push` | POST | Push the current branch, or (PR session) the PR's head branch. |
| `/api/git/pull` | POST | Fast-forward pull, or (PR session) re-sync with the PR head. `409` on divergence or uncommitted changes. |
| `/api/git/commit-message` | POST | Dispatch the selected harness to write a commit message for the staged diff. Returns an `agentJob`, polled via `/api/agent/job`. `400` if nothing is staged or no harness is selected. |

Every write endpoint is guarded by `localPost` ([`lspsetup.go`](../../lspsetup.go)), the same POST-only, same-origin, IP-or-localhost check every other mutating px0 endpoint uses.

## 10. Unpushed Commits (`@{u}..HEAD`)

Everything above diffs against the working tree. The moment a change is committed it leaves that view entirely — the tree goes clean, the gutter empties, the diff tab closes — even though a local commit is exactly the thing most likely to still need reading. Section 10 is the read path for those commits, from `git commit` until `git push`.

It is strictly read-only: no endpoint here writes to the index, a ref, or a remote. Every call fails quiet the way the rest of `git.go` does — no upstream, no git, or an unknown SHA all yield an empty result rather than an error, and the sidebar section simply doesn't appear.

### Which Commits, and Against What

`gitUpstreamRef(root)` runs `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` and returns the tracking branch as git names it (`origin/master`). `gitUnpushedCommits(root, limit)` then logs `@{u}..HEAD`, newest first.

Unlike `gitAheadBehind`, there is **no `origin/<branch>` fallback and no "count every local commit" fallback**. Those exist so the Push button can still light up on an unpublished branch, where being approximately right is better than being dead. A list of commits is different: measuring it against a branch git does not consider upstream would show a confident, wrong answer. With no upstream configured, `/api/unpushed` reports `available: false` and the section is hidden.

The upstream ref name travels with the list and is rendered beside the section title, because "unpushed" alone doesn't say *unpushed where* — a branch can be ahead of `origin/master` and behind a fork's.

### Per-Commit Reads

Three reads share one set of `git diff-tree` flags (`commitDiffArgs`): `--no-commit-id -r -m --first-parent --root`. That combination gives one entry per **path** rather than per tree, and `--root` means the repository's very first commit still has something to diff against, so it needs no empty-tree special case. `-m --first-parent` makes a merge commit diff against the branch it merged into, which is the only reading of a merge that matches what the sidebar claims to be listing.

| Function | Shell-out | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gitCommitFiles(root, sha)` | `git diff-tree --name-status -z …` + `gitCommitNumstat` (`git show --numstat -z -m --first-parent`) | Paths the commit touched, with git's status letter (`M`/`A`/`D`/`R`/`C`/`T`) and each path's `add`/`del` line counts (`binary` when numstat reports `-`), mapped through `repoRelKey` so a repo served from a subdirectory lists only what it can open. |
| `gitCommitDetail(root, sha)` | `git show -s --format=…` + `git diff-tree --numstat …` | Author, email, relative and ISO dates, the full message, and the files/insertions/deletions diffstat. |
| `gitDiffCommit(root, relpath, sha)` | `git diff-tree -p --no-color …` | The unified diff that commit alone made to one file. |

`gitHunksCommit` feeds `gitDiffCommit`'s output to `parseDiffHunks` — the same state machine `gitHunksAgainst` uses, split out of it so a commit's gutter and the working tree's are parsed by one piece of code.

Every SHA that reaches `exec.Command` as a bare revision passes `validSHA` (`^[0-9a-fA-F]{4,40}$`) first. The only way a SHA reaches these endpoints is from a list px0 itself produced, so anything else is a bug or a probe; refusing it keeps a crafted `--upload-pack=…` out of an argument list.

### The `ref` Parameter on `/api/diff` and `/api/gutter`

Rather than add two more endpoints, the existing diff and gutter endpoints take an optional `ref`:

- **`ref` empty** — unchanged: the working tree against `s.diffBase` (`HEAD`, or a PR merge-base in review mode).
- **`ref=<sha>`** — that commit's own diff, via `gitDiffCommit`/`gitHunksCommit`. The working tree is not consulted at all, so the result is frozen no matter what is edited afterwards.

`/api/file` takes the same parameter, for one reason: a file the commit **deleted** has nothing on disk, so the existing "does the working tree have a diff for it" check can't vouch for it and the open would 404. With a `ref`, `handleFile` asks whether that commit touched the path instead, and returns the same zero-line `deleted: true` document a working-tree deletion produces.

### HTTP Surface

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/unpushed` | GET | `{available, upstream, commits[]}` — commits in `@{u}..HEAD`, newest first. `available: false` with no upstream or nothing ahead. |
| `/api/commitfiles?sha=` | GET | `{sha, files[]}` — the paths one commit touched, with status letters and line counts. Empty list for an unknown SHA. |
| `/api/commitdetail?sha=` | GET | Author, message and diffstat for the hover card. `404` for an unknown SHA. |
| `/api/diff?path=&ref=` | GET | With `ref`, that commit's diff for the file instead of the working tree's. |
| `/api/gutter?path=&ref=` | GET | Same, for the change gutter. |
| `/api/file?path=&ref=` | GET | `ref` only matters for a file the commit deleted; it opens as a zero-line deleted document so its diff can be read. |

All six are GET reads with no `localPost` guard, because none of them changes anything.

### Frontend (`web/src/unpushed.js`)

The section lives under the file tree in the sidebar, behind the same **changed files only** toggle as the dirty-file filter — it is a review view, not a home-screen fixture. That toggle's availability is now `hasGitView()` in `tree.js`, which is true when there are working-tree changes **or** unpushed commits: committing everything empties the tree, and without counting commits the toggle would disable itself exactly when the section it reveals became the only thing worth looking at. On a clean tree the tree stops claiming the sidebar's spare height (`#tree.changed-only.no-changes`) and says "Working tree clean", leaving the section the whole of the view.

Clicking a commit expands it into its file list, badged with the same `git-M`/`git-A`/`git-D` classes the tree uses. Clicking a file opens it with `openFile(path, { ref, view: 'diff' })`. A tab carries that commit on `d.diffRef`, shows `@<short-sha>` in the tab strip, and renders its diff in a labelled `In commit <sha>` section. Opening the same path from anywhere else — tree, search, go-to-definition — passes no ref and puts the tab back on the working tree, which is what "open this file" means everywhere else in px0.

A commit-pinned tab is deliberately invisible to the working-tree reconciliation in `gitstream.js`: it is skipped by the auto-close pass, by the `diffAvailable` sync, and by the reload trigger. The working tree going clean is precisely when you still want to be reading one. The ref is persisted in the workspace session (`SessionTab.Ref`), so a reload comes back pinned.

The list is refreshed from the `ahead` count and head SHA that already ride on every git-status SSE tick, so it re-reads `git log` only when one of them actually moved, and explicitly after a commit, push, pull or reindex. A commit that disappears (amend, rebase, push) drops its cached file list and detail with it. A commit's file rows are built `COMMIT_FILES_PAGE` (100) at a time behind a **Show 100 more** row (`web/src/commitfiles.js`), and only while that commit is open. A squash or a vendor bump can touch thousands of paths: building them all at once for a 20,000-file commit cost 224k DOM nodes and a 550 MB tab, where one page costs about 1,000 nodes.

### Recent Commits (`web/src/gitpanel.js`)

The git panel's Recent Commits list uses the same reads and the same pinned tabs. `/api/git/log` now also returns each commit's full SHA (`full`), so a file opened from either list pins its tab to the same `diffRef`. Clicking a commit expands it into its files from `/api/commitfiles`, drawn with the same `commitfiles.js` rows and paging; collapsing deletes the rows rather than hiding them. The git-status stream re-sends the recent commits on every tick, so the list is rebuilt only when the commits themselves change, and open commits are re-expanded from cache. The short-hash chip copies the SHA; arrow keys, Enter and Space move through commits and files.

### Stepping Through a Commit (`web/src/diff.js`)

A pinned tab's diff view opens with a strip showing the file's status, path, line counts and place in the commit (`3 / 17`), with ‹ › to step to the neighbouring file. The file list comes from `/api/commitfiles` once per SHA through `loadCommitFiles` (`commitfiles.js`), cached and shared with the sidebar rows, since a commit's files never change. `stepCommitFile` (`tabs.js`) opens the next file pinned to the same commit and closes the tab stepped away from, so stepping swaps a tab in place rather than leaving one open per file. Binary files are passed over (`commitStepTarget`): they have no text diff, and `/api/file` refuses to open them.

### Hover Cards That Stay Open (`web/src/cardkeep.js`)

Hovering a commit opens a card with its author, full message and diffstat (insertions green, deletions red), a **Copy SHA** button, and a best-effort GitHub link on the author name: a `users.noreply.github.com` address carries the login outright and becomes a profile link, any other address can only support "this repository's commits by this address", and a non-GitHub remote gets no link at all.

Both this card and the existing LSP hover card used to close before you could reach them. Two separate causes, both fixed in `cardkeep.js`, which now owns the lifetime of each:

1. A card armed its hide from a `mouseleave` on whatever sat underneath it and gave the pointer a fixed window to arrive. Cross the gap slower than that — or pause on the way — and the card was gone before the pointer reached it, with nothing left listening to cancel the timer, because the pointer had already left every element that was.
2. "Is the pointer still near the card" was measured from an anchor captured when the card was *requested*, not when it opened. A hover response can take seconds, so the card could appear anchored to where the pointer used to be, and the very next move read as "left the card".

`makeCardKeeper(el, { hide })` replaces both with one document-level pointer track — so the pointer is never unobserved, wherever it goes — one timer per card, and every decision made against where the pointer is *now*: inside the card (plus slack), or anywhere in the rectangle spanned by the anchor and the card, which is the path a pointer travelling towards it takes. `reanchor()` moves that rectangle's origin when an awaited card finally renders, so a slow response can't strand it.

## 11. Revision Helpers for Local Review

`px0 -review` ([Local Review](local-review.md)) checks an agent's comments against a commit that is not necessarily checked out, so `git.go` has read-only helpers that take a revision:

- `revParseCommit(root, rev)` resolves a revision to a full commit SHA with `git rev-parse --verify --quiet <rev>^{commit}`. A revision that starts with `-` or contains a NUL or newline is refused before git runs, so a name from a file or flag can never become an option.
- `gitTreeFiles(root, rev)` lists every path in a commit with one `git ls-tree -r --name-only -z`, so "is this path in that commit" is a map lookup for any number of comments. It returns nil when the commit cannot be listed.
- `gitFileLines(root, rev, path, max)` returns a file's lines as of a commit. It asks `git cat-file -s` for the size first so a blob over `max` bytes is never read, and returns nil for a missing or binary file (a NUL in the first 8000 bytes).
- `shortSHA(sha)` abbreviates a SHA to 12 characters for display.
